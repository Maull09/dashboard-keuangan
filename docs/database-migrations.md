# Database migrations and recovery

`npm run db:migrate` uses the official Drizzle migrator through a plain Node.js runner. It prints pending migration names, verifies the required schema afterward, and exits unsuccessfully on connection, migration, or readiness errors. It does not infer migration history from the presence of an account table.

## Normal workflow

1. Confirm that `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` targets the intended database.
2. Back up existing financial data and stop application writes during migration work.
3. Prefer Supabase Direct connection or the Session pooler (port 5432) for migrations and backups. Use the Session pooler when the direct host is unreachable on an IPv4-only network.
4. Run `npm run db:migrate`.
5. Run `npm run db:migrate -- --check` before restarting the app.

The read-only check validates required tables, columns, types, nullability, defaults, serial sequences, primary/foreign keys, enum values, and the presence of required named checks/indexes. It also requires the latest migration timestamp in history and checks the auth role, private-table RLS flags, and ownership policy presence. It does not compare every catalog property, check expression, index expression, policy expression, or permission.

Normal readiness checks accept additional nullable columns, such as
`transactions.group_name` from another feature branch. Expected columns must still
match, and unknown `NOT NULL` columns are rejected, even if they have defaults.
Explicit baseline adoption requires the exact column set and still rejects extra
nullable columns. If a migration finished but its readiness check failed, inspect
the reported difference and rerun `npm run db:check` after correcting the checkout
or verifier; an already-recorded migration does not need to be reapplied.

Generating migrations is not applying them. An account endpoint can succeed while the dashboard fails because `stock_trades` has not been created. This version expects 20 application tables and migration `0013_groovy_talkback`, including AI conversations/drafts, transaction groups, four-decimal numeric trade quantities/prices, and private ownership policies. Migration 0005 widens only the trade price column from `numeric(14, 2)` to `numeric(16, 4)`. Migrations 0006–0007 add ownership and RLS without assigning existing rows; follow [authentication setup](authentication.md) to assign legacy records to a confirmed owner. Back up before applying migrations.

Migrations 0009–0010 add indexes for ownership-scoped pagination, date/type filters, account references, and payment/contribution joins. They do not update financial rows or change RLS. Run the normal migration workflow before deploying the optimized queries; generating the SQL alone does not install the indexes. These transactional `CREATE INDEX` statements can block writes while building, so use a maintenance window for a large database.

Migration 0011 adds `api_cache_revisions` and transaction-scoped invalidation triggers
for private financial tables and shared market data. The application role can read
only its user's revision and the shared market revision; trigger functions own all
revision writes. Financial rows and amounts are preserved. Apply it before enabling
`REDIS_URL`; see [local Redis setup](development.md#local-redis-cache).

Migration 0012 adds the AI tables; see [AI setup](ai-assistant.md) for the private receipt bucket. Migration 0013 adds nullable `transactions.group_name` with its name-validation constraint. The grouping branch originally used migration number 0011, which is already occupied by Redis in main. This combined checkout preserves Redis 0011 and AI 0012, and places grouping at 0013. Run the normal migration workflow even if the grouping column was already installed from that branch: 0013 accepts the existing column and named constraint without rewriting transactions or dropping group names, then records the combined migration history.

## Existing legacy tables with empty migration history

This recovery is only for the nine-table schema represented by `0002_uneven_killer_shrike`. It is not a general-purpose way to mark arbitrary SQL as applied.

1. Confirm the database identity and suspend other schema/data changes.
2. Create a PostgreSQL **custom-format** backup covering both `public` and `drizzle`, using `pg_dump` of the same or a newer major version than the server. For PostgreSQL 17, use version 17 or newer, not 16.
3. Validate the archive with `pg_restore --list`. A full restore rehearsal in a separate database provides stronger assurance; never rehearse over the original database.
4. Keep the backup private. Local `backups/` is ignored by Git, but ignored files are not encrypted or stored remotely. Copy important backups to protected storage.
5. Run the explicit recovery once:

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate -- --baseline=0002 --backup=backups/your-validated-backup.dump
   npm run db:migrate -- --check
   ```

The runner requires an existing non-empty custom archive. It checks the archive header; the operator must verify the archive contents and that it belongs to the intended database. It locks legacy tables and migration history, rejects non-empty history or a mismatched legacy schema, and records the exact hashes/timestamps for migrations 0000–0002 without replaying their SQL. Unexpected public tables are rejected during legacy adoption.

Baseline adoption is one transaction. Pending SQL is then applied in a separate Drizzle transaction. If the new migration fails, a verified baseline can remain recorded; fix the reported cause and rerun normal migration. Do not rerun baseline adoption or delete the history table.

Neither adoption nor migration 0003 updates existing financial rows. Migration 0003 creates the six investment/sinking-fund tables and their constraints/indexes.

## Connection and certificate errors

Copy credentials from Supabase Connect and URL-encode password characters when necessary. Never include the connection URL or credentials in bug reports. The migration runner reports PostgreSQL/connection error codes without logging query parameters or the URL.

For verified TLS, download the project CA from Supabase **Database settings → SSL configuration**. Set `DATABASE_CA_CERT` in the local or deployment environment to its PEM value; literal line breaks, escaped `\n`, and single-line values are supported. The application and database scripts always verify the certificate and hostname. For PostgreSQL backup tools, use `PGSSLMODE=verify-full` plus `PGSSLROOTCERT`. Do not disable certificate or hostname verification to work around a missing CA. See [Supabase SSL configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ssl-enforcement) and [connection methods](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres).

A failed command is not proof that no migration ran: check the schema/history before retrying. Do not use forced schema pushes, drop user tables, or manually fabricate migration entries.
